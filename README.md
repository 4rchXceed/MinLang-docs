# MinLang documentation

This is the documentation for the MinLang project (run with `mkdocs serve`).

(I might add github pages deployment later.)

## Note on some examples

These examples were written in a pre-alpha version of MinLang, so some syntax may differ from the current version. (For updated documentation, see the docs/ folder.)

## This uses mkdocs.
